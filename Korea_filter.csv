AI-CDSS-Cardiovascular-Silo,"The artificial intelligence plays an essential role as an assistant to the physicians in decision making for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow up. However, the smartness and intelligence of the system depends on the knowledge base. There are many knowledge resources of knowledge for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention such as published guidelines, articles, real practice data, and experts‚Äô heuristics and experiences. The proposed system AI-CDSS for HF diagnosis evolves the knowledge base with hybrid knowledge acquisition approach by emergence of expert-driven and data-driven approaches. The knowledge acquisition methodology is inspired from our previous work",Ubiquitous Computing Lab,"Gyeonggi-do, Yongin-si, Giheung-gu, Yeongdeok-dong, ÎçïÏòÅÎåÄÎ°ú 1732",[],https://github.com/ubiquitous-computing-lab/AI-CDSS-Cardiovascular-Silo.git,4,0
