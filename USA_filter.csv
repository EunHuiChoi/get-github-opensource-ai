Liri-Bot2019,"# LIRI Bot  ### Overview  In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  ### Before You Begin  1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.  3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.     * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)     * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)       * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)     * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)     * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)     ## Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.  * Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).  * Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.   * Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.  If you haven't written a markdown file yet, [click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions.  ### Submission on BCS  * Please submit the link to the Github Repository!  ### Instructions  1. Navigate to the root of your project and run `npm init -y` &mdash; this will initialize a `package.json` file for your project. The `package.json` file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a `package.json` file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project.  2. Make a `.gitignore` file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.  ``` node_modules .DS_Store .env ```  3. Make a JavaScript file named `keys.js`.  * Inside keys.js your file will look like this:  ```js console.log('this is loaded');  exports.spotify = {   id: process.env.SPOTIFY_ID,   secret: process.env.SPOTIFY_SECRET }; ```  4. Next, create a file named `.env`, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:  ```js # Spotify API keys  SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret  ```  * This file will be used by the `dotenv` package to set what are known as environment variables to the global `process.env` object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github &mdash; keeping our API key information private.  * If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own `.env` file for it to work.  5. Make a file called `random.txt`.     * Inside of `random.txt` put the following in with no extra characters or white space:       * spotify-this-song,""I Want it That Way""  6. Make a JavaScript file named `liri.js`.  7. At the top of the `liri.js` file, add code to read and set any environment variables with the dotenv package:  ```js require(""dotenv"").config(); ```  8. Add the code required to import the `keys.js` file and store it in a variable.    * You should then be able to access your keys information like so    ```js   var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);   ```  9. Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:     * `concert-this`     * `spotify-this-song`     * `movie-this`     * `do-what-it-says`  ### What Each Command Should Do  1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`     * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API (`""https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/"" + artist + ""/events?app_id=codingbootcamp""`) for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:       * Name of the venue       * Venue location       * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as ""MM/DD/YYYY"")  2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`     * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window       * Artist(s)       * The song's name       * A preview link of the song from Spotify       * The album that the song is from     * If no song is provided then your program will default to ""The Sign"" by Ace of Base.     * You will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.     * The Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a **client id** and **client secret**:     * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>     * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.     * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the ""complete"" button.     * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).  3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`     * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:       ```        * Title of the movie.        * Year the movie came out.        * IMDB Rating of the movie.        * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.        * Country where the movie was produced.        * Language of the movie.        * Plot of the movie.        * Actors in the movie.      ```     * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'       * If you haven't watched ""Mr. Nobody,"" then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>       * It's on Netflix!     * You'll use the request package to retrieve data from the OMDB API. Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key. You may use `trilogy`.  4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`     * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.       * It should run `spotify-this-song` for ""I Want it That Way,"" as follows the text in `random.txt`.       * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.  ### BONUS  * In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.  * Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file.   * Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.  ### Reminder: Submission on BCS  * Please submit the link to the Github Repository!  - - -  ### Minimum Requirements  Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions.

Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions.  In this project, that is exactly what we are going to be doing as well.  Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.  In this project, we will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:  * Isolation Forest Algorithm  Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.  In addition, we will explore the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in our data set.

Credit-card-Fraud-detection,"# Credit Card Fraud Detection ### Presented by Ratnam!  Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions.  In this project, that is exactly what we are going to be doing as well.  Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.  In this project, we will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:  * Isolation Forest Algorithm  Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.  In addition, we will explore the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in our data set. Let's get started!",Ratnam Dubey,Houston,[],https://github.com/RatnamDubey/Credit-card-Fraud-detection.git,2,0
imbalanced-dataset-analysis,"In this project we address the problem of classification on imbalanced classes dataset to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit. We use a number of machine learning and deep learning algorithms: random forest tree, logistic regression, linear supporting vector machine and multi-layer perceptron neural network, to perform the classification. Combining those algorithms with four ways of rebalancing methods, we are able to compare precision, recall, 10-fold cross-validation scores and auc-roc curve of the mentioned method-combinations.  Furthermore, we discuss the reasons of differences among rebalancing methods on different algorithms. LinearSVC has best performance considering processing time and performance indices. Using randomly undersampling, it can achieve the classification sensitivity (recall) of 0.67 and precision of 0.27 with an auc score of 0.72 on class yes. In the end, we took logistic regression algorithm as example to build up our cost-based model, using cross validation to find out the best lowcost rate for class ‚Äúno‚Äù (Known that cost for class ‚Äúyes‚Äù is assigned as 1). Meanwhile we compared it with the f1 score targeted model with best class_weight parameter.",Minjie XU,Boston,[],https://github.com/janeminmin/imbalanced-dataset-analysis.git,2,1

Bluebikes-project,"1>  Background information Bluebikes is Metro Boston‚Äôs public bike share program, with more than 1800 bikes at over 200 stations across Boston and nearby areas. The bikes sharing program launched in 2011. The program aimed for individuals to use it for short-term basis for a price. It allows individuals to borrow a bike from a dock station after using it, which makes it ideal for one-way trips. The City of Boston is committed to providing bike share as a part of the public transportation system. However, to build a transport system that encourages bicycling, it is important to build knowledge about the current bicycle flows, and what factors are involved in the decision-making of potential bicyclists when choosing whether to use the bicycle. It is logical to make hypotheses that age and gender, bicycle infrastructure, safety perception are possible determinants of bicycling. On the short-term perspective, it has been shown that weather plays an important role whether to choose the bicycle.  2> Data collection The Bluebikes collects and provides system data to the public. The datasets used in the project can be download through this link (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data). Based on this time series dataset (start from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00), we could have the information includes: Trip duration, start time and data, stop time and data, start station name and id, end station name and id, bike id, user type (casual or subscribed), birth year, gender. Besides, any trips that were below 60 seconds in length is considered as potentially false starts, which is already removed in the datasets. The number of bicycles used during a particular time period, varies over time based on several factors, including the current weather conditions, time of the day, time of the year and the current interest of the biker to use the bicycle as a transport mode. The current interest is different between subscribed users and casual users, so we should analyze them separately. Factors such as season, day of a week, month, hour, and if a holiday can be extracted from the date and time column in the datasets. Since we would analyze the hourly bicycle rental flow, we need hourly weather conditions data from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00 to complete our regression model of prediction. The weather data used in the project is scrapped using python selenium from Logan airport station (42.38 ¬∞N, 71.04 ¬∞W) webpage (https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/boston/KBOS/date/2019-7-15) maintained by weather underground website. The hourly weather observations include time, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind, wind speed, wind gust, pressure, precipitation, precipitation accumulated, condition. 3> The problem The aims of the project are to gain insight of the factors that could give short-term perspective of bicycle flows in Boston. It also aimed to investigate the how busy each station is, the division of bicycle trip direction and duration of the usage of a busy station and the mean flows variation within a day or during that period. The addition to the factors included in the regression model, there also exist other factors than influence how the bicycle flows vary over longer periods time. For example, general tendency to use the bicycle. Therefore, there is potential to improve the regression model accuracy by incorporating a long-term trend estimate taken over the time series of bicycle usage. Then the result from the machine learning algorithm-based regression model should be compared with the time series forecasting-based models. 4> Possible solutions Data preprocessing/Exploration and variable selection: date approximation manipulation, correlation analysis among variables, merging data, scrubbing for duplicate data, verifying errors, interpolation for missing values, handling outliers and skewness, binning low frequent levels, encoding categorical variables. Data visualization: split number of bike usage by subscribed/casual to build time series; build heatmap to present how busy is each station and locate the busiest station in the busiest period of a busy day; using boxplot and histogram to check outliers and determine appropriate data transformation, using weather condition text to build word cloud. Time series trend curve estimates: two possible way we considered are fitting polynomials of various degrees to the data points in the time series or by using time series decomposition functions and forecast functions to extract and forecast. We would emphasize on the importance to generate trend curve estimates that do not follow the seasonal variations: the seasonal variations should be captured explicitly by the input weather related variables in the regression model. Prediction/regression/time series forecasting: It is possible to build up multilayer perceptron neural network regressor to build up models and give prediction based on all variables of data, time and weather. However, considering the interpretability of model, we prefer to build regression models based on machine learning algorithms (like random forest or SVM) respectively for subscribed/casual users. Then the regressor would be combined with trend curve extracted and forecasted by ARIMA, and then comparing with the result of time series forecasting by STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) with multiple seasonal periods and the result of TBATS (Trigonometric Seasonal, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA residuals, Trend and Seasonality).",Minjie XU,Boston,[],https://github.com/janeminmin/Bluebikes-project.git,1,1

Titanic_Analysis,"Exploring Survival on the Titanic The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this project I will analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive using scikit learn logistic regression model. In particular, I will apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.

Global-climate-change-analysis,"Air is one of the important factor for us and we can see that it is deteriorating day by day, which in return is causing many health problems and increasing the temperatures of the planet which is leading to change in climatic pattern and many other short term problems which we are able to notice, there are also many long term effects of this pollution which we are not giving much importance. These include depletion of polar ice caps, increase in sea levels and depletion of ozone layer which would have severe effect on our environment. We would like to throw light on these long-term problems and their relationship with increase in air pollution. We are analyzing the patterns of various air pollutants from the past 20 years from each country and continent. We are taking data from fifteen different datasets form UN data report understanding each of them, cleaning and filling the missed data using tidyr, diply. We used ggplot2 for plotting their graphs, to visualize their trends and determining the major air pollutant, the sources from which it is being emitted. The effects of this pollution on the depletion of snow caps, raise in sea level and the increase in the pollution levels depending on the GDP of each country. We are also predicting the future parameters of each data using machine learning algorithms.",Saran Tejas Kaja,"Boston,MA",[],https://github.com/kajasaran/Global-climate-change-analysis.git,1,0

Movie-Recommendation-System,"In this notebook, we have analysed the data from movielens dataset and tried to implement recommender system for movies. For this dataset, our main challenge was sparsity of user-movie matrix which means that the number of movie which are rated by user are very less compared to number of movies which are not rated by that same user. As part of data pre-processing, various type of matrix formation has been implemented as per the requirement of all algorithms used in this notebook. we have tried to analyse both neural network and tradition algorithms for recommender system in this notebook. In deep learning, we have implemented Restricted boltzmann machine, Deep Autoencoder, and simple deep neural network to predict the ratings and provide the recommendation based of predicted ratings for the user which has not rated that movie before in the dataset. In traditional algorithms, we have implemented various method of collaborative filtering such as SVD Matrix factorization, SVD++ and Hybrid model.

Machine-Learning-Coursera-AndrewNg,"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.  This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.",Gunjan Khut,"Boston, Massachusetts",[],https://github.com/gkkhut/Machine-Learning-Coursera-AndrewNg.git,3,0
